### CLI Commands (main.py):

* image: The name of the target image in evolving_circles/input.
* --genes: Number of genes/ circles the trained image should have.
* --generations: Number of generations the image should be trained over.
* --size: Resize the trained image, trained image has the same dimensions as the target image by default.
* --save: Save the trained image in evolving_circles/output with the given name.
